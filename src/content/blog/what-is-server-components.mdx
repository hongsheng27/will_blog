#  Benefits of Server Rendering

#### 1. Data Fetching
Fetching data from the server, which means it is close to the data source. This can reduce data fetching time and the number of requests clients make, improving performance.

#### 2. Security
Sensitive data and logic can be kept on the server for better security.

#### 3. Cache
Caching reused data on the server for better performance.

#### 4. Bundle Size
Keeping large dependencies on the server benefits users with slow internet and less powerful devices, as they do not need to download too much on the client side.

#### 5. Initial Page Loading
HTML can be generated to allow users to view the page immediately, without waiting for the client to download, parse, and execute JavaScript needed to render the page.

#### 6. SEO
Server rendering improves SEO by pre-generating HTML for search engine crawlers and social network bots, enabling better indexing and generating social card previews for pages.

#### 7. Streaming
By splitting the render work into different parts in server components, users can see some parts earlier instead of waiting for the whole page to finish rendering.

By default, **Next.js** uses server components. Developers can fully control the use of server components or client components based on different scenarios.



### How Are Server Components Rendered?

The rendering work is split into different parts by individual **route segments** and **Suspense Boundaries**.

Each block is rendered in two steps:

#### **On the Server Side**
1. React renders Server Components into a special data format called the **React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload)**.
2. Next.js uses the RSC Payload and Client Component JavaScript instructions to render HTML on the server.

#### **On the Client Side**
1. The HTML is used to immediately show a fast, non-interactive preview of the route (for initial page load only).
2. The **React Server Components Payload** is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees and update the DOM.
3. The JavaScript instructions are used to hydrate Client Components and make the application interactive.



### What is React Server Component Payload (RSC)?

The **RSC Payload** is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It is used by React on the client to update the browser’s DOM.

The **RSC Payload** contains:
- The rendered result of Server Components.
- Placeholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files.
- Any props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component.



### What is Hydration?

**Hydration** is the process of attaching React event listeners to already-existing HTML DOM nodes, making the page interactive.



### Server Rendering Strategies

#### **1. Static Rendering (Default)**
With **static rendering**, routes are rendered at **build time**. It is useful when a route has data that is not personalized to the user and can be known at build time, such as a **static blog post** or a **product page**.

#### **2. Dynamic Rendering**
With **dynamic rendering**, routes are rendered **for each user at request time**. This is useful when a route contains **personalized data** or data that can only be known at request time, such as:
- Cookies
- URL search params (e.g., fetching a specific user profile based on the URL parameters)

**Example:**  
Users click a button to view a profile → The user ID is set in the URL params → The API fetches specific user data.

**Next.js** automatically selects the best rendering strategy based on the features and APIs used. Instead of manually choosing static or dynamic rendering, developers control **caching** and **revalidation** of specific data, and may opt to **stream** parts of the UI.



### Streaming

**Streaming** enables progressive UI rendering from the server by splitting work into different blocks. This allows users to see parts of the page **immediately**, before the entire content has finished rendering.

#### **Benefits of Streaming**
- **Faster initial page load**
- **Improved user experience for UI dependent on slow data fetches** (e.g., loading reviews on a product page)

Streaming is **built into the Next.js App Router by default**.
